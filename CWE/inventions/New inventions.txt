#Web 1.0 is a retronym applied to the early iterations of the internet defined by a few static, user-created, web pages that lacked much interactivity.


web_2 = { #Web 2.0
#Web 2.0, also called the participatory web or the social web, refers to the iteration of the internet defined by interaction, content creation, and ease of use. This era of the internet is defined by websites that allow users to not only consume content, but also generate it themselves - as well as connect and interact with other users.


web_3 = { #Web 3.0
#Web 3.0, or Web3, refers to a potential iteration of the internet that heavily relies on technological decentralization through blockchain technology, digital or crypto currency, and increased user privacy and anonimity. In theory, it seeks to be an internet completely controlled and guided by users rather than centralized external actors, corporations, or governments.


new_left = { #New Left
The New Left was a social movement in the West among the left that sought to create social movements and pressure towards emerging issues at the time such as extended political and civil rights, enviromentalism, feminism, gay rights, and more. These movements often distinquished themselves from previous ones in their heavier focus on social justice rather than solely on class struggle - with many seeing it as a revitilization of the left in the western world.

eurocommunism = { #Eurocommunism
#Eurocommunism refers to a strain of communist thought that emerged in Western Europe during the later decades of the Cold War. Defined by a rejection of Soviet-style communism, it instead attempted to increasingly work within the systems found in western states in order to effect change, broaden their appeal, and reach out to new social movements emerging at the time. Often it also sough a reconciliation between the politics of the far-left with more reformist views, often abandoning the more hardline elements of class struggle and Marxist influence in favor of a more 'moderate' appearance.

human_immunocontraception = { Human-Approved Immunocontraception
#Immunocontraception, the process of utilizing an animal's immune system to prevent pregnancy or impregnation, has long been studied in nature. For decades the application to human contraception remained far-off, with concerns over safety, reversibility, and the method of transfer being debated issues among scientists. However, recently breakthroughs in medical science have allowed a method that has been deemed safe enough for wide-spread human use - ushering in a new and more potent form of contraception.

#Sustainable Population refers to differing controversial proposals individuals, organizations, and governments for a population total for Earth beyond which the the whole population cannot be fully sustained. While each are widely criticized for their own reasons, many proponents cite everything from the Earth's resources, environmental changes, to war, and even religious or political motivations for the figures they give.

internet_activism = { #Internet Activism
#Internet Activism refers to the use of online mediums such as social media, instant message, video sharing sites, or more for the purposes of enabling faster and more effective forms of organization by social movements. The end result is usually a much more wide-scale and far-reaching movement with influences from beyond even the nation in which it was organized.
