To test and balance unit strengths do this

# copy the USA and RUS oob's to history/units/USA_oob.txt and RUS_oob.txt (decide to test a narrow or wide army)
# copy RUS - Russia.txt to history/countries/
# copy Test_War to history/wars

Test - Army
Run the game as USA and in Berlin attack the military unit of RUS in East Berlin.

Test - Navy
Run the game as RUS. In Pyongyang North Korea make your navy leave port.
Then switch tag in the command to USA, and attack the RUS navy with your Navy stationed in Inchon South Korea.
# tag USA
