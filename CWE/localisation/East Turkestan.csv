EVTDESC8013807;With China still embroiled in war - now with itself rather than Japan - Xinjiang has once more been left as a functionally autonomous frontier of the Chinese state. Left to fend for itself, wracked with political and economic instability, and without much support from the rest of China the long-standing tensions between the ethnic Uyghur population and the ruling Chinese have since boiled over into a war that threatens China's loosening grip over its western reaches. \n\n Already the Uyghur people have risen up to win their liberation from China. With the 'Second East Turkestan Republic' standing triumphant in the north, and support from the USSR continuing to provide legitimacy, the position of the revolution against Chinese rule has never been stronger. Even still, there remain obstacles to creating a Uyghur state - the leadership of the new Republic is as divided as the Uyghur people on the future of the republic, with the only uniting factor being the threat of continued Chinese rule.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013808;For over a decade now the Soviets have stood by the 'Frontier' lands of China and its people, providing aid to Uyghur rebels, helping to organize political organization, and even briefly siding with the former governor of the region Sheng Shicai to advance the cause of socialism and equality within the province. The most recent manifestation of this support has been the Second East Turkestan Republic, made up of exiles that were based out of the USSR prior to their return to their homeland. \n\n However, with the peace treaties that followed the Second World War there has come demands to 'withdraw' from the region entirely - facilitating a return to the Republic of China, which enjoys special privileges on the newly created UNSC. While many within the Soviet leadership are sure to take issue with the abandonment of the Uyghurs, Stalin has voiced his support in following through with the agreements reached - hoping instead to consolidate his influence among Eastern Europe and foster better relations with the advancing forces of Mao in China by facilitating the removal of the more traditionalist Uyghur leader Tore in favor of those more friendly to the prospect of peace.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013809;The Soviets have made a sudden move today by recalling Elihan Tore back to the Soviet Union. While Tore has served as the de facto head of the Second East Turkestan Republic since its creation, tension between he and the Soviet leadership has only flared in recent months. With the conclusion of the Second World War, and the surrender of both Japan and Germany aid from the Soviet Union has been replaced with increasing pressure to cede to at least some Chinese demands, demands that will be made easier with Tore's departure from the nation and power instead falling onto the more Moscow aligned Ehmetian Qasim.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013810;Hoping to put an end to hostilities that have plagued the province now for the past few years, the Xinjiang provincial government has come to us with an offer for a ceasefire and negotiations for an end to our aspirations for independence. While at first such an offer seems almost unthinkable to consider, they haven't come empty-handed. Instead, there are promises to work towards a compromise that will allow autonomy for our people and potential statehood within Xinjiang's existing government. Even still, such a move is likely to dash hopes of the more hardline members of our government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013811;East Turkestan, in a surprising move, has accepted our offer for a ceasefire. Already fighting is stopping across the nation - with only a few small skirmishes continuing in the more remote areas and among unaffiliated bands of rebels. While this on its own will do little to end tensions, it is a first step towards securing peace.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013812;Despite our best efforts to reach a ceasefire agreement, negotiations have broken down yet again. With this final blow its likely the only solution to the issue of the Second East Turkestan republic will be a violent one. While our people are weary of war and our government unstable, we will persevere and attempt to quell unrest in China's furthest reaches.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013813;With the ceasefire already implemented, negotiations have been underway on a more permanent agreement with the Xinjiang government on the status of the East Turkestan Republic and the Uyghur people that for so long have faced repression at the hands of the Chinese. So far these negotiations have produced an interested proposal - one of a coalition government in which the leadership of East Turkestan will enjoy administrative and political power within the northern regions of the province in exchange for an end to hostilities and a reunification with China. While obviously this deal means an end to our statehood, the chances of it securing a future for the Uyghur people are surely worth it.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013814;The leadership of the rebellious north has accepted to our proposal to unite under the common banner as part of a coalition government! While this will limit Xinjiang's authority across the province, it is a small price to pay for stability and security. With luck, this still shaky relationship will prove to be lasting.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013815;With the decision of the Second East Turkestan Republic's leadership to reject our offer of a coalition government, a devastating blow has been dealt to the efforts for a peaceful resolution to one of the provinces many woes. Even the ceasefire, shaky and tenuous, has started to break - with reports of fighting breaking out once more coming in from across the north as it seems the only path forward is one of a military suppression of the northern regions of the nation.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013816;With the surrender of the last holdouts of the 'Xinjiang' government to East Turkestani forces, the long-standing Chinese rule of the so-called 'Frontier' has ended. Already celebrations have started to take place in major cities as word spreads, with the leadership busy drafting a formalized constitution for a new state as they prepare for elections and the creation of more concrete governing structures. A vast majority of the leadership hopes to create a state modeled after either Mongolia or the Soviet Union, aiming to replicate the economic growth and industrialization in the relatively undeveloped East Turkestan - a desire opposed by more moderate figures that hope for a transitional phase before the Uyghur people push forward towards more hardline socialism.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013817;The Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has long stood as an ally to the Uyghur people, having supported the Second East Turkestan Republic and helped to educate and advise many of those that now find themselves in positions of power within its government. This on its own has driven many to desire a more Soviet aligned future for our new state, however two more major factors have turned us towards our comrades west – those being China and the emerging Cold War. \n\n It is hoped that Soviet alignment will provide protection from China, who will no doubt desire a reclamation of the region once the Civil War finally ends. Soviet protection would massively deter any efforts to undermine our independence. Not only that, but the emerging economic bloc of socialist nations headed by the Soviets also provides an opportunity to develop our abysmal economy that has been ruined by colonialism and years of war.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013818;Decades of instability, warlordism, corruption war, social strife, and political infighting have seen China torn asunder. Nowhere is this current more evident than in Xinjiang, where the provincial government has been ousted and overthrown by rebel groups aligned with the Soviets who aim to destabilize and divide us for their own aims. However, the time has come to present this self-proclaimed state with an ultimatum – to join with a united China and cede power back to the legitimate government or to face an invasion from China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8013819;With a KMT victory in the Chinese Civil War, the leader of China Chiang has presented us with an ultimatum regarding our separation from China and aspirations from statehood. He has asked that we lay down our weapons and arms, end our ‘rebellion’, cede power back to the Xinjiang regional government, and rejoin China - If we refuse, he has threatened to invade. While China’s armies are likely heavily weakened from its Civil War, even the more hardline among the government are doubtful about how long an independent and isolated East Turkestan could stand up to the entire nation – though even still many are more than prepared to fight for their hard-earned freedom.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023800;With China still embroiled in war - now with itself rather than Japan - Xinjiang has once more been left as a functionally autonomous frontier of the Chinese state. Left to fend for itself, wracked with political and economic instability, and without much support from the rest of China the long-standing tensions between the ethnic Uyghur population and the ruling Chinese have since boiled over into a war that threatens China's loosening grip over its western reaches. \n\n Since 1944 Xinjiang has been struggling to contain the rebellious provinces in the North, with the self-proclaimed 'Second East Turkestan Republic' - with support from the Soviet Union - continuing to push for liberation and self-determination. While their goals, as of yet, remain out of reach the tenuous situation in the rest of the province has shaken faith in the current governor, as well as in the ability to move forward without significant change to the governing structures put in place by the KMT.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023801;Since the 1930s there have been a series of rebellions and conflicts within Xinjiang, mainly centered around the ethnic divide between the ruling Chinese and the native Uyghur population. Such conflict has fueled political instability, economic ruin, and a dwindling support for the institutions of the Republic of China. These matters were only made worse by the war with Japan and now the Civil War as they threaten to rend Xinjiang from China entirely. To that end many within the government are proposing a solution, hopefully permanent, to conflict in the Chinese frontier. A ceasefire would go a long way to securing stability in the region, and allow both the legitimate government as well as the self-proclaimed Uyghur state to work together to find common ground as they work towards a united China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023802;Facing a crumbling economy, social and political unrest, decreasing faith in the KMT government in the region, and a full on rebellion from the ethnic Uyghur population the central government in Beijing has decided to exert what little authority they have over the province. They are calling for the removal of the  current governor, Wu Zhongxin – a member of the right wing of the KMT and its CC Clique – who has served since 1944. Instead a more moderate figure, Zhang Zhizhong, has risen to replace him. \n\n Already the new governor has drawn criticism from the strong influence of the CC Clique in the region for his more left-leaning stance and the emphasis on cooperation with the rebel groups. Even still, many hope that Zhizhong will be able to finally bring stability to the province and return to under the direct influence of the rest of the mainland once more.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023803;With a ceasefire secured, now comes efforts for a lasting peace. One of the most plausible proposals, and likely the last chance for a non-violent resolution to the Uyghur issue, is one in which we offer to enter into a coalition with the rebel government in exchange for a cessation of hostilities and joint efforts on rebuilding Xinjiang as a Chinese province. Its likely that such a proposal will draw anger from more loyalist elements of the government – as well as the central government based in Nanjing – however it remains one of the few options given the situation within the province.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023804;Zhang Zhizhong has served as governor for little under a year now, rising to power mainly off of the failures of the previous regime – failures many feel he has done little to remedy. The province remains stricken by a failing economy and social unrest, and the controversial concessions to the Uyghur rebels as well as the perceived leftist alignment have instead placed the hopeful governor at odds with not only his more conservative rivals but the central government as well. Already he has been asked to step down, with the KMT presenting two possible replacements as they make their case to lead Xinjiang. \n\n Masud Sabri is currently the most favored of the two. Despite his controversial views regarding pan-Turkic nationalism and his background as an ethnic Uyghur, he is seen as a figure that can keep Soviet influence at bay, sway the Turkic population, and steer the province towards a more friendly KMT alignment. However, more radical right elements of the provincial KMT have instead advocated Bai Chongxi lead – hoping to secure their own influence over the province and strengthen their grip within the party.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023805;With Zhizhong out of the picture, the time has come to address his legacy in the province. Despite only being in power for under a year, he had made substantial efforts to open up its politics and empower its Uyghur population – two things that have combined to weaken the government’s position and undermine its authority. The KMT as a whole is almost unanimously united in opposing them and working to undo enough to secure its power – though even still a few voices have presented the idea of keeping the reforms, if only temporarily to help build faith and trust with a weary population.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023806;While the Second East Turkestan Republic might be gone, its legacy is far from forgotten. The Uyghur continue to suffer under Xinjiang’s rule, and the ineffective, unstable, and increasingly hostile government has made no significant progress in addressing their concerns. With minimal effort it may be possible to rekindle the flames of revolution among the people, though such a move would likely come with some controversy within China and the West – being seen as an act of aggression against an already struggling China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023807;Across the northeastern parts of the nation efforts are underway by the Soviets and Mongols to spread dissent among the Uyghur population. Calls to arm, socialist propaganda, and newsletters slandering the government have found their way among the population centers – fueling unrest and anger towards the government and further frustrating an already tense situation. Police and military forces, spread thin as they are, have already been dispatched to deal with a bulk of the unrest – with some in the government now demanding we make a move to try to assert ourselves against our increasingly belligerent neighbors.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023808;A wave of violence has swept across the northern and eastern parts of the province in recent days, with mobs of Uyghurs assaulting non-Muslims and their fellow believers alike in a display of hatred towards the Chinese administration. Local forces have thus far managed to keep some semblance of order, however as the flames continue to grow and reports of deaths and armed attacks mount it is becoming increasingly clear that reinforcement of these long rebellious regions will once more be needed. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023809;With unrest still sweeping the country it was only a matter of time before things spiraled even further out of control. During one of the more violent uprisings in Turfan, Ma general Chengxiang has reportedly been at the helm of what the locals are calling a massacre. While numbers and exact details are scarce, it would seem that even with reinforcements from the neighboring province of Qinghai we will find little respite as an even deeper wedge is driven between the local government and its people.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023810;Since mid 1947, and even before, skirmishes and small scale fighting has taken place along the border with the Mongolian People’s Republic – with small changes having constantly taken place over the years. Such fighting mainly comes down to the continued communist support for Uyghur rebels, and has only worsened in severity as efforts continued to stop collaboration with rebel and attempted invasions of the province. Currently our forces are poised for yet another escalation, with the aim being to send a message to the Mongols and Soviets that Xinjiang is still capable of defending itself and continued interference in our affairs and people will not be tolerated. \n\n However, not all in the government are as keen on this plan. In particular more left-leaning elements believe any such escalation will be sufficient provocation to see yet another Soviet invasion – instead arguing that we continue efforts to win over the Uyghur people through peaceful concession while simply ignoring the efforts to undermine our government.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023811;Long having raided our borders and harassed soldiers and civilians alike, the bandit warlords and petty cliques have again tried to provoke a response by escalating their attacks in recent days. Our forces have already repelled a bulk of the attacks, with Soviet and Mongolian air raids helping to further deter this recent spat of violence – stabilizing the borders and reversing the minimal changes that had taken place. However, some are not satisfied in merely pushing back the Chinese this time. Once before already Mongolia has had to temper its efforts in China, and more nationalist leaning members of the MPRP see this as the best opportunity to push for what we have desired so long – as well as to provide support for those sympathetic to us among the Uyghur population and the Xinjiang government such as the pro-Soviet Li Rihan. While its sure to draw criticism from both Moscow and China alike, it is likely this will be one of the few chances to secure our interests in China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023812;Continued troubles have prompted yet another change to the leadership of Xinjiang by the central government. Once more the more conservative factions of the Xinjiang clique have put forward a candidate in opposition to the favored by the KMT’s leadership. Currently Burhan Shahidi, a more moderate figuring promising to bring economic prosperity back to the province and a former member of the now deposed Shicai’s government, is the favored to be appointed to the position of governor. He is opposed by the traditionalist and hardline nationalist Yulbars Khan, who has vowed a ruthless and merciless crackdown on dissent, as well as a vocal and zealous opposition to the communist forces threatening the province.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023813;A proposed plan to help stabilize the ruinous economy of Xinjiang has been put forward by more moderate elements of the Xinjiang government as they scramble to salvage the situation. The move, aiming to restore local currency and combat inflation, has been met with opposition from more hardline elements that see it as a betrayal of the Republic of China – though their voices have thus far on mostly deaf ears as rising costs and dwindling coffers threaten to further deepen the provinces woes.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023814;With our victory in the mainland, we now set our sights on the wayward province of Xinjiang. While it has mostly escaped the fighting that raged during the civil war, it still remains nominally and legally a part of the now defeated Republic of China. To fully secure our victory over the rightist factions of the KMT we should send an ultimatum to the leadership of this effectively autonomous province demanding they surrender to the legitimate and rightful government of China.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023815;A delegation from the communist government, who now stands triumphant in China, headed by Deng Liqun has arrived to offer to negotiation the terms of our surrender to the new government in China. Many within the government have already signaled their willingness to defect, with former governor Zhizhong cooperating with the new communist government and calling for a full concession to their demands.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023816;Decades of instability, warlordism, corruption war, social strife, and political infighting have seen China torn asunder. Nowhere is this current more evident than in Xinjiang, China’s frontier province that has long enjoyed a light touch from a central government too plagued by its own troubles to exert more than a passing amount of influence. That all changes now, however. With the civil war at an end, the communists defeated, the time has come to call on the KMT within the province to fall in line with the rest of China. While we are confident that the weakened clique in charge will not put up much of a fight, our weary forces are prepared to take up arms once more to ensure lasting peace. ;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC8023817;With the Nationalist Government triumphant the Generalissimo himself, Chiang Kai-shek, has personally seen to it that Xinjiang be brought back in line with the rest of the mainland. While we have enjoyed autonomy thus far, it has come at a price – and many within the Xinjiang branch of the KMT have expressed little dissent at the prospect of coming under more direct rule once more, with only more left-leaning elements and the Uyghur rebels hoping for a continued independence in the region.;;x;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
